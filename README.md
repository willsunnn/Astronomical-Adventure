Astronomical Adventure Game

This is a 2D game in space implemented using JFrame. It is basically a gravity simulator, where the player can pilot a rocket around the solar system under the influence of gravity from planets and the sun.

Using keylisteners and mouselisteners, the player can control the rocket as well as shoot bullets. As the player approaches a planet, the player will enter a planet level where there may be another spaceship or a boss that the player can shoot to kill.

The Polygon class was used to accurately represent entity hitboxes as well as display the player's location on the minimap of the game. 

Custom sprites were created for the purpose of the game. Sound Effects and Animations were implemented as part of the game as well, but were not designed by me. 

Run the Driver's void main(String[] args) method to start the game
